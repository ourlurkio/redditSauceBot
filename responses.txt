Frankly, my dear, I don't give a sauce!
I'm gonna make him a sauce he can't refuse!
You had me at 'sauce'!
Go ahead, make my sauce!
Sauce, for a lack of a better word, is good!
May the sauce be with you!
I love the smell of sauce in the morning!
The stuff that sauces are made of!
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice sauce!
Show me the sauce!
